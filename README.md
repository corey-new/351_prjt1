In this project, you should read in a file name from the terminal. The given skel.cpp runs a for loop over a set of hash programs. In each iteration of this for loop, a child process is forked. The parent sends the file name to the child. The child calls a function to compute the respective hash (as specified by the hash program) of the file name. The child sends the computed hash value back to the parent.
